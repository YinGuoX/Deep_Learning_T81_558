        "# Part1.2 : Introduction to Python\n",
        "Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.Create by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python has become a common language for machine learning research and is the primary language for TensorFlow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a significant of the language that is not entirely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3. This course makes use of Python3. Furthermore, TensorFlow is not compatible with versions of Python earlier than 3. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation(PSF), manages and directs resources for Python development. On janury 1, 2020, the PSF discontinued the Python 2 language and no longer provide security patches and other improvements. Python interpreters are availabelfor many operating systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first two modules of this course provide an introduction to some aspects of the Python programming language. However, entire books focus on Python. Two modules will not cover every detail of this language. The reader is encouraged to consult additional sources on the Python language.\n",

Thois method of invoking the print command is no longer allowed in Python 3. Similarly, it used to be a  performance improvement to use the xrange command in place of range command at times. Python 3 incorporated all of the functionality of xrange Python 2 command into the normal range command. As a result, the programmer should not use the xrange command in Python 3. If you see either of these constructs used in example code, then you are looking ar an older Python 2 era example.\n",
